### I. Introduction
A ball and plate system is an example that allows for testing, and control of artificial intelligence algorithms. Two stepper motors control the angle of a plate. Each stepper motor will control the x axis, and y axis of plate motion. Adjustment of the plate position in order to control ball orientation, keeping it balanced on top of the plate is the goal. A controller for the ball and plate system will be designed, mathematical model analysis performed, and a simulation using MATLAB/Simulink for the ball and plate system. 

### II. Modeling
The figure below shows a simplified model of the the ball and plate system parameters:

m=mass of the ball

h=height of the motor arm

r_arm=radius of the motor arm

r=radius of the ball

L=length of the plate

ùõº=angle of the plate

Œ∏=angle of the motor arm

J=moment of inertia of the ball

  Fig. 1: Ball and Plate Model 

A nonlinear equation of motion is derived from Fig. 1: Ball and Plate Model, above. The equation, seen below uses the geometry of the motor, and the plate. Equation 2, and 3 are derrived to find ùõº and Œ∏. Substituting equations 2, and 3 into equation 1 yields equation 4. Taking a small angle approximation, seen in equation 5, and the taking the laplace transform, seen in equation 6, the final transfer function of one motor is found, below in equation 7.
